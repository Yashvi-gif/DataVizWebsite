    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
   Meeting existing demands without putting energy demands of the future on stake is a critical challenge for any economy, considering the environmental and economic aspects of sustainability. To achieve this, we need to ensure that we maintain ecological balance and consume the resources at a rate lower than the rate at which these resources can replenish themselves so that we don't land in a position where non-renewable sources of energy have exhausted.
The supply and consumption of any utility goes hand in hand. To understand any changes that occur and to plan for the future, it is crucial to collect and visualize the data related to consumption and production of energy in order to derive related information and patterns/trends in the same. This helps each government to make sound policy and investment decisions to progress and move towards sustainability. 
This dataset collection provides insights to the consumption levels of different types of energies in different regions of the world or one specific country (here, Australia).  To successfully transition towards sustainability, it is critically important to understand the contribution of different sources of energy and their impacts on the environment like CO2 emissions. It is equally important to compare the renewable sources of energy with the exhaustible ones. We must carefully analyze these visualisations and try to obtain answers to the questions intended audience has in mind. 
    <h1>VALIDATION</h1>

    <p class="penhance">
    For testing our visualizations, we asked a random person whom we did not know to test our visualization. We showed him our completed visualizations on the website and asked him if to interpret them and if he finds it easy comprehend them or not.
The following is the feedback provided to us after viewing the 3 visualisations:
<ul> <li> Tooltip and highlighting interactivity is an efficient way of focusing and depicting the information linked to each graph. However, for the stacked bar chart, he stated that it was tough to derive information regarding the actual energy consumption levels for every source since we do not have the overall consumption of energy for every state.</li>
<li>   Stacked area chart efficiently displays the trends over the years and answers most of the questions stated. He recommended to modify it to add the interactivity of converting it into a line chart that displays the values for each year, as stated in the Optional features. </li>
<li>  For the scatter plot, he liked the button interactivity of adjusting the x-axis range interactivity. However, since we did not have the data of all the countries belonging to every continent, we can’t make comparisons or conclude anything based on continents. </li>
</ul>
