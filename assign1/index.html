    <h2 class="Mainhead">All About Energy</h2>
    <p>Sustainability means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. For this, we need to ensure that we maintain balance in earth's environmental systems and use the resources at a rate where those energy sources are able to replenish themselves so that we don't land in a position where all energy sources have exhausted keeping in mind the increasing population of the world.
The supply and usage of energy goes hand in hand. To understand any changes that occur and to plan for the future, it is highly important to collect and visualize the data in order to derive related information and trends in energy. This helps the government to make sound policy and investment decisions to move progress and move towards sustainability. It can also be used by various Energy linked organizations, environmentalists and researchers for variety of research purposes.
 This dataset collection provides insight to the consumption levels of different types of energies in different regions of the world or one specific country.  To successfully transition towards sustainability, it is critically important to understand the contribution of different sources of energy and their impacts on the environment. It is equally important to compare the renewable sources of energy with the exhaustible ones. We must also pay attention to the difference in consumption levels of the households along with the production of these energies.
 For this, we need to ensure that we maintain balance in earth's environmental systems and use the resources at a rate where those energy sources are able to replenish themselves so that we donate land in a position where all energy sources have exhausted keeping in mind the increasing population of the world.On a daily scale, using lights in buildings, driving cars, cooling or heating our homes we rely on energy. Energy is divided among four economic sectors:
      <ul>
        <li>Residential - home and apartments</li>
        <li>Commercial - offices, malls, stores, schools, hotels, hospitals, restaurants</li>
        <li>Transportation - facilities and equipments used for agriculture, mining and manufacturing</li>
        <li>Industrial - vehicles that transport people or goods</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation. Renewable energy often provides energy for electricity generation to a grid, air and water heating/cooling, and stand-alone power systems. About 20% of humans' global energy consumption is renewables, including almost 30% of electricity. About 8% of energy consumption is traditional biomass, but this is declining.Over 4% of energy consumption is heat energy from modern renewables, such as solar water heating, and over 6% electricity.</p>

    <p> Many nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of their energy supply, with some generating over half their electricity from renewables. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the 2020s and beyond. A few countries generate all their electricity using renewable energy. Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits </p>
